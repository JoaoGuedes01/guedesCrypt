guedesCrypt is a lightweight library for encryping strings in nodejs

##  Features

- Encrypt your strings with a secret salt defined by you(Do not share this salt as it is the key to decrypt the string)

- Decrypt your encrypted strings with the same salt. (Using a different salt from the encryption one will result in erronous strings)

##  Installation

guedesCrypt requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh

cd [yourproject]

npm i guedes-crypt

```
##  Usage
To encrypt a String you need a secret salt to use in the guedesEncrypt function

```sh

let string = "This is the string I want to encrypt"
let salt = "THIS IS MY SECRET SALT"

let encryptedString = guedesEncrypt(salt,string);
// This will result in '407c7d67347d6734607c71346760667d7a73345d3463757a6034607b34717a77666d6460'

```

To decrypt a String you need the same secret salt used in its encryption as well as the encrypted string

```sh

let decryptedString= guedesDecrypt(salt,encryptedString );
// This will result in 'This is the string I want to encrypt'

```
